								Perception is above all, the basis of all knowledge. Coming from the Latin word “percipere” which means to “take hold as a whole”, perception is the collection of sensory information that surrounds us. It refers to the idea of judgment or immediate understanding of things at a given time and place. To perceive is thus to collect and to recognize how our senses are variously affected by the presence of things and how they act on our senses in return.

															Perceiving your own body, it’s shape, it’s reach, it’s possibilities and it’s limits into space is very important to grasp the world surrounding you. What are the differences between the outline of my own body (a limited portion of space) and the rest of the world? The body is an object like any other, with a certain form with delimited borders, which evolves in a more global space occupied by a multitude of other objects. It can be measured, drawn, sculpted, even cut out. I have internal access to my body. I can close my eyes, and know the position of my own limbs. In addition to the information given by the five classical senses (vision, touch, hearing, smell and taste), we are constantly receiving signals about the state of our body from a series of sensory receptors. These internal «senses» are specialized in processing information about this range of bodily experiences.

																	In order to explore this idea of the perception of your own body into space, it’s physical reach and limitations, I participated in a workshop with the juniors of the ICK Amsterdam dance company. It consisted in experiencing a dance method that “helps the body to expand in order to achieve a certain sensitivity. It allows the body to create a direct connection with the skin and the mind.” Since ancient times, Indigenous cultures have used gesture and line to describe forces that are felt through the body. In addition to the movement of bodies in space, there is the movement of space within bodies. This workshop aimed to experience an inner energy «world» that unfolds in space. However, as shown by Laban, our bodies express themselves within a restricted movement vocabulary because our gestures are restricted by anatomical structures. In order to explore the limits of these restrictions, the instructions for this workshop were first,  to make oneself small, as compact as possible; then to stretch out to the maximum towards the ceiling in order to reach the limits of gravity right down to ones fingers; and finally to do this extreme stretch a dozen times. By dint of repetitions, stretching, twisting, and combinations of these, I realized that I was able to make myself smaller and smaller, then more and more elastic. The whole point was to circulate my own motor energy in my own body: you need to take something somewhere to be able to redistribute it elsewhere. I then take my place in space. Carolina Verra, one of the junior dancers present during this workshop said: “this body, since we were born, holds in itself the whole of us; our body, through its movement, is able to put us in communication with others and with nature; and it allows us to express emotions, passions, dreams, feelings, impulses and intuitions.”

																	This “muscular sens” meaning the capacity of identifying the the location of our own muscles and limbs, was named “proprioception” as soon as 1906 by the English physiologist Charles Sherrington. Proprioception is scientifically explained as all the nervous information transmitted to the brain on the location of the different parts of our body in relation to each other and of our body in space. It is used to regulate our balance and our posture through the contraction of certain muscles which corresponds to the deep sensitivity of the body. This information comes from receptors called proprioceptive receptors located on the muscles, tendons, ligaments of the joints as well as on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. However some disorders can cause a proprioception dysfunction that affect any part of the proprioceptive system between the sensory receptors that send the signals to the parts of the brain that receive and interpret them. Proprioceptive Dysperception Syndrome being one of them, it affects the regulation of postural tone, sensory spatial localization and multisensory perception. The symptoms are having impaired if any nervous information transmitted to your brain on the position and sensations of your movements and limbs in relation to our environment and according to the other parts of our body. The programming of the internal schemes of the movement is not done or only partially, thus the subject coordinates with difficulty his gestures which are clumsy. In severe cases, any daily task is difficult as if you do not look at your limbs and surroundings, you cannot place them in space.
																	Moving around requires a wheelchair since it is impossible to constantly watch your legs and feet to be able to induce movement. Similarly, grabbing a glass of water requires looking at your arm and hand to be able to place them at the correct hight and close your fingers on the glass. These types of cognition diseases truly show the limits of the body and how the perception of it in space plays a role in every move you make, from walking to eating and drinking.

			<p>
				The “own body” is what I act through, the body which belongs to me and which embodies my existence. This body, not the mind, is the knowing subject. This body knows how to act and react in a given situation. This is the idea of embodied knowledge. But what is the perception of my “own body” in a given space? How to become aware of the relationship that my body has with what surrounds it and with itself? How does my body communicate with others? I am interested in how the human body works, the signals it sends, and how this impacts communication and interaction with others.
			</p>

			<p>
				I am using the theoretical frame-work and clear logical analysis established by western contemporary thinkers of the early 20th century like Bergson, Merleau-Ponty and Laban to experience how I perceive my “own body”, it’s capacities and it’s limits through practice-based breathing and dancing workshops. Previous medical discoveries on cognition diseases are also important to understanding the limitations in perceiving your “own body”.
			</p>

			<p>
				After studying the historical sources on the origin of language and artistic sources putting in evidence the attempts at creating a universal language system, I understand the utopian nature of such a task. Moreover, I believe that we can use familiar tools to express understanding of experience, and not be restricted to the use of photographic stereotypes. I want to develop an interactive survey as a way of encouraging people to reflect on and transcribe their body perception in a simple, repeatable manner. The results of which could be correlated visually and demographically. By gathering concepts of body perception by word, colour and line drawing, and creating visual languages for signals they send, I aim to, to some extent, create a universal visual language.
			</p>

			<p>
				As a graphic designer in the learning, I want to bring attention to the body’s patterns of signage, which is a system based on iconic and/or linguistic semantics with contingencies.
			</p>


			<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

			<p>
				Merleau-Ponty places at the center of his analysis the notion of “own body”, that is to say the body as a place of sensations and perceptions. The “own body” is what I act through, the body which belongs to me and which embodies my existence. What if this body, not the mind, is the knowing subject.? That he knows how to act and react in a given situation? This is the idea of embodied knowledge. Embodied knowledge is not confined only to motor skills, but is concerned with the variety of human experiences (that is, the impression that reality makes on our senses), all of which share the property of doing without representing. There is no need for representation because there exists a pre-reflective correspondence between body and world.
			</p>

			<p>
				But what is the perception of my own body in a given space? How to become aware of the relationship that my body has with what surrounds it and with itself? How does my body communicate with others? I am interested in how my own body works, what signals do I send with it, and their effect on communication and interaction with others.

			<p>
				After laying the foundations of the idea of the perception of your own body into space, it’s possibilities and it’s limits;I then study the origine of language and the study of visual/bodily language. This premises having been established, I can show the process of translation of <span class="burger1" onclick="openNav1()">body experience</span> into a communication system.
			</p>


			<h2 id="chapter-1">I- The perception of your own body into space, it’s possibilities and it’s limits.</h2>

			<p>
				Perception is above all, the basis of all knowledge. Coming from the Latin word “percipere” which means to “take hold as a whole”, perception is the collection of sensory information that surrounds us. It refers to the idea of judgment or immediate understanding of things at a given time and place. To perceive is thus to collect and to recognize how our senses are variously affected by the presence of things and how they act on our senses in return.
			</p>

			<p>
				Perceiving your own body, it’s shape, it’s reach, it’s possibilities and it’s limits into space is very important to grasp the world surrounding you. What are the differences between the outline of my own body (a limited portion of space) and the rest of the world? The body is an object like any other, with a certain form with delimited borders, which evolves in a more global space occupied by a multitude of other objects. It can be measured, drawn, sculpted, even cut out. I have internal access to my body. I can close my eyes, and know the position of my own limbs. In addition to the information given by the five classical senses (vision, touch, hearing, smell and taste), we are constantly receiving signals about the state of our body from a series of sensory receptors. These internal «senses» are specialized in processing information about this range of bodily experiences.
			</p>

			<p>
				However, our sensory system is not limited to the 5 senses standardly mentioned; our body also registers other sensory information such as those related to the position and movement of our body in space (kinesthetic sense, vestibular sense). Having a good perception of space is first of all the ability to position oneself, to move around, to orient oneself, to make multiple decisions, to analyze situations within our environment and the relationship of our body with it.
			</p>

			<p>
				Rudolf Laban, devoting himself to the study of dance movement, theorized the representation of the human movement potential: the “kinesphere”. This model refers to the space directly accessible to a person, it extends all around them, determined by the extension of the legs and arms, in all directions without changing the base of support, and taking into account anatomical limitations. Laban’s choreutic prototypes exploit a spherical movement space around the center of gravity of the body using symmetrical trace-forms swinging up and down, from side to side, and in front and behind the body. His representation is similar to De Vinci’s “Vitruvian Man”, taking into account the measurements of the body, only applying them to all 3 horizontal, vertical, and sagittal plans. This imaginary sphere placed around the person is mainly used in dance and in theater to symbolize the personal space of the artist and it’s physical reach.
			</p>

			<p>
				In order to explore this idea of the perception of your own body into space, it’s physical reach and limitations, I participated in a workshop with the juniors of the ICK Amsterdam dance company. It consisted in experiencing a dance method that “helps the body to expand in order to achieve a certain sensitivity. It allows the body to create a direct connection with the skin and the mind.” Since ancient times, Indigenous cultures have used gesture and line to describe forces that are felt through the body. In addition to the movement of bodies in space, there is the movement of space within bodies. This workshop aimed to experience an inner energy «world» that unfolds in space. However, as shown by Laban, our bodies express themselves within a restricted movement vocabulary because our gestures are restricted by anatomical structures. In order to explore the limits of these restrictions, the instructions for this workshop were first,  to make oneself small, as compact as possible; then to stretch out to the maximum towards the ceiling in order to reach the limits of gravity right down to ones fingers; and finally to do this extreme stretch a dozen times. By dint of repetitions, stretching, twisting, and combinations of these, I realized that I was able to make myself smaller and smaller, then more and more elastic. The whole point was to circulate my own motor energy in my own body: you need to take something somewhere to be able to redistribute it elsewhere. I then take my place in space. Carolina Verra, one of the junior dancers present during this workshop said: “this body, since we were born, holds in itself the whole of us; our body, through its movement, is able to put us in communication with others and with nature; and it allows us to express emotions, passions, dreams, feelings, impulses and intuitions.”
			</p>

			<p>
				With this performative art technique, you become aware of the internal state of one’s own body, how to articulate it, but also to give it an intention in a given space. In that same idea, I experimented paced breathing which is known to impact body mechanics and to be tied with body awareness. Paced breathing is a slow, deep, diaphragmatic breathing. With normal breathing, you take about 12 to 14 breaths a minute. By comparison, with paced breathing you take only 5 to 7 breaths a minute. The paced breaths are smooth and deep enough to move your diaphragm (the muscular wall located beneath your lungs) as you take deeper breaths. By focusing on where to breath, you truly focus on the muscle-to-mind connection: you visualise/perceive your own body moving, actively engaging the targeted muscle as you engage in movement with the intention to do so. You feel the air moving through your nostrils, into your abdomen, expand your stomach and the sides of the waist, while keeping your chest relatively still. This technic is the basis of almost all meditation or relaxation techniques. It takes in more air which oxygenate your muscles better. This makes them work more efficiently and reinforces proper body mechanics that put less stress on your body as you move, thus allowing less restricted movement.
			</p>

			<p>
				This “muscular sens” meaning the capacity of identifying the the location of our own muscles and limbs, was named “proprioception” as soon as 1906 by the English physiologist Charles Sherrington. Proprioception is scientifically explained as all the nervous information transmitted to the brain on the location of the different parts of our body in relation to each other and of our body in space. It is used to regulate our balance and our posture through the contraction of certain muscles which corresponds to the deep sensitivity of the body. This information comes from receptors called proprioceptive receptors located on the muscles, tendons, ligaments of the joints as well as on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. However some disorders can cause a proprioception dysfunction that affect any part of the proprioceptive system between the sensory receptors that send the signals to the parts of the brain that receive and interpret them. Proprioceptive Dysperception Syndrome being one of them, it affects the regulation of postural tone, sensory spatial localization and multisensory perception. The symptoms are having impaired if any nervous information transmitted to your brain on the position and sensations of your movements and limbs in relation to our environment and according to the other parts of our body. The programming of the internal schemes of the movement is not done or only partially, thus the subject coordinates with difficulty his gestures which are clumsy. In severe cases, any daily task is difficult as if you do not look at your limbs and surroundings, you cannot place them in space.
				Moving around requires a wheelchair since it is impossible to constantly watch your legs and feet to be able to induce movement. Similarly, grabbing a glass of water requires looking at your arm and hand to be able to place them at the correct hight and close your fingers on the glass. These types of cognition diseases truly show the limits of the body and how the perception of it in space plays a role in every move you make, from walking to eating and drinking.
			</p>

			<p>
				Losing the information of sensations is to lose the ability to inscribes onself into the world in which it can interact. This perception of our own body aims to adapt it to the world. Sensations make it possible for us to understand something of the feelings expressed in movements, the behaviors that each other must adopt in reaction to others, like a type of language.
			</p>


			<h2 id="chapter-2">II- The origine of language and the study of visual/bodily language.</h2>

			<p>
				According to Henri Bergson (1859 -1941) in The Creative Mind, men invented  language only in order to facilitate communication between them with an aim of achieving a common work. In his demonstration, he affirms that language has only one purely inciting function. Words and ideas are thus, primarily “utilitary”. But what is the primitive function of language? Is language only meant as “spoken words” or as a visual system, signs juxtaposed together in order to facilitate communication?
			</p>

			<p>
				The sign (whether it is graphic or not) is a device capable of translating heterogeneous languages, which makes it possible to conceive a commensurability (meant as the capacity of describing the world for what it is exactly) between different syntaxes, such as the syntaxes of verbal, gestural, perceptual and visual languages. This commensurability is made possible not through a relationship between isolated units, but through relationships between discursive forms belonging to different semiotics (verbal, visual, gestural, etc.). The sign is therefore a device allowing translations, even transpositions, in order to identify commensurabilities allowing it to signify beyond the expressive capacities of verbal language.
			</p>

			<p>
				Honorary Professor of Applied Linguistics Charles Goodwin (1943-2018) wrote in 1994:
				“A theory of discourse that ignored graphic representations would be missing both a key element of the discourse that professionals engage in and a central locus for the analysis of professional practice. Instead of mirroring spoken language these external representations complement it, using the distinctive characteristics of the material world to organize phenomena in ways that spoken language can’t, for example by collecting records of a range of disparate events onto a single visible surface” (p. 611, “Professional Vision”).
			</p>

			<p>
				When Goodwin approaches the phenomenon of translation between speech and inscriptions, in the case, for example, of the activities of scientists, archaeologists or geologists, he asserts that the search for commensurability aims at the construction of a totality. This totality can be understood as the result of a demonstrative process. This process, by the simple fact of bringing together and translating heterogeneous signs through a single perspective, brings a surplus of knowledge.
				I consider the idea of transcription - which concerns gestures, looks, and perceptual movements within shared action - is already an example of the systemization of experience. Through transcription, one seeks in fact to represent heterogeneous syntaxes and to constitute them in a totality where the heterogeneities are still perceptible, but at the same time are made translatable.
				The problem facing theorists of the relations between verbal, visual or gestural languages, such as Benveniste, is the presumed freedom of non-verbal languages. Gestures, sounds and images would all lack a finite repertoire of signs and syntactic rules to govern their sequences; no grammatical rules that would guarantee the intelligibility of gestural or visual statements, the predictability of their occurrences or their transmissibility thanks to a universally accepted notation.
			</p>

			<p>
				The challenge of so-called bodily semiotics, which aims to go beyond the semiological conception of language, is to demonstrate that the image of the body has a level of articulation such that it can produce predicates in total autonomy from verbal language. Language practices then function as forms of laboratory experience that provide answers to our hypotheses.
			</p>

			<p>
				If, generally, all notation tries to make discontinuous and regulated what is continuous - think of the notation of dance and other more or less formalized gestures, such as conducting an orchestra or a performance for example. In a way, the notation of oral verbal discourse could be seen as approaching language as if it were of the same complexity as a musical performance or a ballet. Indeed, it is not only, nor even essentially, the meaning of words that guides us in the transcription, but that of the gestural forms, of the rhythms, which are arranged according to the practical relevance of the situation, and not to the through a priori codifications of verbal language and its system. The segmentation is therefore done by the rhythms of the perceptual flows of attention and by visual prominences. Thus, this segmentation is respecting the continuum of visual (and gestural) language. Finally, it respects the fact that any opposition between signs is always tensive and gradual.
				This work of comparison is important not only because it approaches the visual and the gestural systems as autonomous languages compared to the verbal language, but also because it calls into question the approach of the verbal language as a fixed system of units, showing the usefulness of analyzing it as a continuous gesture in a practical multimodal framework.
			</p>

			<p>
				In order to create a democratic body language system, it is important to record a stabilized base of language habits which is called upon during exchanges for the construction of new skills and knowledge: “New structures for the accomplishment of consequential action are progressively created by performing systematic transformative operations on what already exists ” (Goodwin, 2016, p. 5, “The co-operative, transformative organization of human action and knowledge”), this base would therefore be identifiable with a reservoir of uses sedimented throughout history which intervenes in the structuring organization of local action.
			</p>

			<p>
				In semiotics, this relationship between novelty in the current action and sedimentation of practices makes possible the relationship between what is feasible, relevant, possibly programmable, and what is produced by the actual adjustment of the actors. This schematization of the movements inherent in the production of meaning has, in my opinion, the merit of making visible the complexity of our language operations taken between creation and sedimentation, because it multiplies the stages of this process. This is why it is important in my opinion to record these recursive language practices of the body and to create a basis for a demoncratic body language.

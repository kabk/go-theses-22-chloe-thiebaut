									The “own body” is what I act through, the body which belongs to me and which embodies my existence. This body, not the mind, is the knowing subject. This body knows how to act and react in a given situation. This is the idea of embodied knowledge. But what is the perception of my “own body” in a given space? How to become aware of the relationship that my body has with what surrounds it and with itself? How does my body communicate with others? I am interested in how the human body works, the signals it sends, and how this impacts communication and interaction with others.
								</p>

								<p>
									I am using the theoretical frame-work and clear logical analysis established by western contemporary thinkers of the early 20th century like Bergson, Merleau-Ponty and Laban to experience how I perceive my “own body”, it’s capacities and it’s limits through practice-based breathing and dancing workshops. Previous medical discoveries on cognition diseases are also important to understanding the limitations in perceiving your “own body”.
								</p>

								<p>
									After studying the historical sources on the origin of language and artistic sources putting in evidence the attempts at creating a universal language system, I understand the utopian nature of such a task. Moreover, I believe that we can use familiar tools to express understanding of experience, and not be restricted to the use of photographic stereotypes. I want to develop an interactive survey as a way of encouraging people to reflect on and transcribe their body perception in a simple, repeatable manner. The results of which could be correlated visually and demographically. By gathering concepts of body perception by word, colour and line drawing, and creating visual languages for signals they send, I aim to, to some extent, create a universal visual language.
								</p>

								<p>
									As a graphic designer in the learning, I want to bring attention to the body’s patterns of signage, which is a system based on iconic and/or linguistic semantics with contingencies.

								Merleau-Ponty places at the center of his analysis the notion of “own body”, that is to say the body as a place of sensations and perceptions. The “own body” is what I act through, the body which belongs to me and which embodies my existence. What if this body, not the mind, is the knowing subject.? That he knows how to act and react in a given situation? This is the idea of embodied knowledge. Embodied knowledge is not confined only to motor skills, but is concerned with the variety of human experiences (that is, the impression that reality makes on our senses), all of which share the property of doing without representing. There is no need for representation because there exists a pre-reflective correspondence between body and world.
							</p>

							<p>
								But what is the perception of my own body in a given space? How to become aware of the relationship that my body has with what surrounds it and with itself? How does my body communicate with others? I am interested in how my own body works, what signals do I send with it, and their effect on communication and interaction with others.

							<p>
								After laying the foundations of the idea of the perception of your own body into space, it’s possibilities and it’s limits;I then study the origine of language and the study of visual/bodily language. This premises having been established, I can show the process of translation of body experience into a communication system.

										Perception is above all, the basis of all knowledge. Coming from the Latin word “percipere” which means to “take hold as a whole”, perception is the collection of sensory information that surrounds us. It refers to the idea of judgment or immediate understanding of things at a given time and place. To perceive is thus to collect and to recognize how our senses are variously affected by the presence of things and how they act on our senses in return.

								<h2>
									What is it to perceive/feel/understand your own body into space?
								</h2>

										<p>
											Perceiving your own body, it’s shape, it’s reach, it’s possibilities and it’s limits into space is very important to grasp the world surrounding you. What are the differences between the outline of my own body (a limited portion of space) and the rest of the world? The body is an object like any other, with a certain form with delimited borders, which evolves in a more global space occupied by a multitude of other objects. It can be measured, drawn, sculpted, even cut out. I have internal access to my body. I can close my eyes, and know the position of my own limbs. In addition to the information given by the five classical senses (vision, touch, hearing, smell and taste), we are constantly receiving signals about the state of our body from a series of sensory receptors. These internal «senses» are specialized in processing information about this range of bodily experiences.
										</p>

										<p>
											However, our sensory system is not limited to the 5 senses standardly mentioned; our body also registers other sensory information such as those related to the position and movement of our body in space (kinesthetic sense, vestibular sense). Having a good perception of space is first of all the ability to position oneself, to move around, to orient oneself, to make multiple decisions, to analyze situations within our environment and the relationship of our body with it.
										</p>

										<p>
											Rudolf Laban, devoting himself to the study of dance movement, theorized the representation of the human movement potential: the “kinesphere”. This model refers to the space directly accessible to a person, it extends all around them, determined by the extension of the legs and arms, in all directions without changing the base of support, and taking into account anatomical limitations. Laban’s choreutic prototypes exploit a spherical movement space around the center of gravity of the body using symmetrical trace-forms swinging up and down, from side to side, and in front and behind the body. His representation is similar to De Vinci’s “Vitruvian Man”, taking into account the measurements of the body, only applying them to all 3 horizontal, vertical, and sagittal plans. This imaginary sphere placed around the person is mainly used in dance and in theater to symbolize the personal space of the artist and it’s physical reach.

								<h2>
									The possibilities of your body with breathing, expanding, dancing, performative art.
								</h2>

										<p>
											In order to explore this idea of the perception of your own body into space, it’s physical reach and limitations, I participated in a workshop with the juniors of the ICK Amsterdam dance company. It consisted in experiencing a dance method that “helps the body to expand in order to achieve a certain sensitivity. It allows the body to create a direct connection with the skin and the mind.” Since ancient times, Indigenous cultures have used gesture and line to describe forces that are felt through the body. In addition to the movement of bodies in space, there is the movement of space within bodies. This workshop aimed to experience an inner energy «world» that unfolds in space. However, as shown by Laban, our bodies express themselves within a restricted movement vocabulary because our gestures are restricted by anatomical structures. In order to explore the limits of these restrictions, the instructions for this workshop were first, to make oneself small, as compact as possible; then to stretch out to the maximum towards the ceiling in order to reach the limits of gravity right down to ones fingers; and finally to do this extreme stretch a dozen times. By dint of repetitions, stretching, twisting, and combinations of these, I realized that I was able to make myself smaller and smaller, then more and more elastic. The whole point was to circulate my own motor energy in my own body: you need to take something somewhere to be able to redistribute it elsewhere. I then take my place in space. Carolina Verra, one of the junior dancers present during this workshop said: “this body, since we were born, holds in itself the whole of us; our body, through its movement, is able to put us in communication with others and with nature; and it allows us to express emotions, passions, dreams, feelings, impulses and intuitions.”

											With this performative art technique, you become aware of the internal state of one’s own body, how to articulate it, but also to give it an intention in a given space. In that same idea, I experimented paced breathing which is known to impact body mechanics and to be tied with body awareness. Paced breathing is a slow, deep, diaphragmatic breathing.

									Perception is above all, the basis of all knowledge. Coming from the Latin word “percipere” which means to “take hold as a whole”, perception is the collection of sensory information that surrounds us. It refers to the idea of judgment or immediate understanding of things at a given time and place. To perceive is thus to collect and to recognize how our senses are variously affected by the presence of things and how they act on our senses in return.

								The origine of language, it’s purpose and it’s tools.

									<p>
										Perceiving your own body, it’s shape, it’s reach, it’s possibilities and it’s limits into space is very important to grasp the world surrounding you. What are the differences between the outline of my own body (a limited portion of space) and the rest of the world? The body is an object like any other, with a certain form with delimited borders, which evolves in a more global space occupied by a multitude of other objects. It can be measured, drawn, sculpted, even cut out. I have internal access to my body. I can close my eyes, and know the position of my own limbs. In addition to the information given by the five classical senses (vision, touch, hearing, smell and taste), we are constantly receiving signals about the state of our body from a series of sensory receptors. These internal «senses» are specialized in processing information about this range of bodily experiences.
									</p>

									<p>
										However, our sensory system is not limited to the 5 senses standardly mentioned; our body also registers other sensory information such as those related to the position and movement of our body in space (kinesthetic sense, vestibular sense). Having a good perception of space is first of all the ability to position oneself, to move around, to orient oneself, to make multiple decisions, to analyze situations within our environment and the relationship of our body with it.
									</p>

									<p>
										Rudolf Laban, devoting himself to the study of dance movement, theorized the representation of the human movement potential: the “kinesphere”. This model refers to the space directly accessible to a person, it extends all around them, determined by the extension of the legs and arms, in all directions without changing the base of support, and taking into account anatomical limitations. Laban’s choreutic prototypes exploit a spherical movement space around the center of gravity of the body using symmetrical trace-forms swinging up and down, from side to side, and in front and behind the body. His representation is similar to De Vinci’s “Vitruvian Man”, taking into account the measurements of the body, only applying them to all 3 horizontal, vertical, and sagittal plans. This imaginary sphere placed around the person is mainly used in dance and in theater to symbolize the personal space of the artist and it’s physical reach.

								The «spoken work» in comparaison to visual language.
							</h2>

									<p>
										In order to explore this idea of the perception of your own body into space, it’s physical reach and limitations, I participated in a workshop with the juniors of the ICK Amsterdam dance company. It consisted in experiencing a dance method that “helps the body to expand in order to achieve a certain sensitivity. It allows the body to create a direct connection with the skin and the mind.” Since ancient times, Indigenous cultures have used gesture and line to describe forces that are felt through the body. In addition to the movement of bodies in space, there is the movement of space within bodies. This workshop aimed to experience an inner energy «world» that unfolds in space. However, as shown by Laban, our bodies express themselves within a restricted movement vocabulary because our gestures are restricted by anatomical structures. In order to explore the limits of these restrictions, the instructions for this workshop were first, to make oneself small, as compact as possible; then to stretch out to the maximum towards the ceiling in order to reach the limits of gravity right down to ones fingers; and finally to do this extreme stretch a dozen times. By dint of repetitions, stretching, twisting, and combinations of these, I realized that I was able to make myself smaller and smaller, then more and more elastic. The whole point was to circulate my own motor energy in my own body: you need to take something somewhere to be able to redistribute it elsewhere. I then take my place in space. Carolina Verra, one of the junior dancers present during this workshop said: “this body, since we were born, holds in itself the whole of us; our body, through its movement, is able to put us in communication with others and with nature; and it allows us to express emotions, passions, dreams, feelings, impulses and intuitions.”

										With this performative art technique, you become aware of the internal state of one’s own body, how to articulate it, but also to give it an intention in a given space. In that same idea, I experimented paced breathing which is known to impact body mechanics and to be tied with body awareness. Paced breathing is a slow, deep, diaphragmatic breathing. With normal breathing, you take about 12 to 14 breaths a minute. By comparison, with paced breathing you take only 5 to 7 breaths a minute. The paced breaths are smooth and deep enough to move your diaphragm (the muscular wall located beneath your lungs) as you take deeper breaths. By focusing on where to breath, you truly focus on the muscle-to-mind connection: you visualise/perceive your own body moving, actively engaging the targeted muscle as you engage in movement with the intention to do so. You feel the air moving through your nostrils, into your abdomen, expand your stomach and the sides of the waist, while keeping your chest relatively still. This technic is the basis of almost all meditation or relaxation techniques. It takes in more air which oxygenate your muscles better. This makes them work more efficiently and reinforces proper body mechanics that put less stress on your body as you move, thus allowing less restricted movement.
